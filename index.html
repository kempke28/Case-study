            <h2 class="paragraph-title">Overview</h2>
            <p class="paragraph-content">The little pokemon list, using mainly JavaScript, HTML and CSS. If you are a pokemon game fan, this list will help you identify some pokemon and their stats. It’s a basic list where you can find a pretty much any monster, at the moment it only have 500 specimens due to learning reasons, but can be expanded to all the list of them. I think, the final result for the user to use was very easy and intuitive</p>
        </div>

        <div class="description-paragraph-container">
            <h2 class="paragraph-title">Purpose</h2>
            <p class="paragraph-content">Was created with the main purpose to get more in dept into JavaScript, json, and APIs around the web. It also helps develop more around understanding with html and basic introduction to CSS libraries like Boostrap. This awesome basic list allows users to filter their favorite pokemon and view some stats about them. As said before, it doesn’t have very much functionality apart of showing the pokemon and make a filter out of them.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="description-paragraph-container">
            <h2 class="paragraph-title">Objetive</h2>
            <p class="paragraph-content">The main objective was to really wrasp JavaScript functionality since I had 0 to less experience with it, understand and learn new functions and a quick intro to the first real programing language. I think the main problem was me against the language, just trying to understand the chains of how JS is built and apply it to the project. Looked many YouTube and other platforms.</p>

            <h2 class="paragraph-title">Duration</h2>
            <p class="paragraph-content">I don’t know how much it would normally take to learn and make this type of projects; I would say it took me a while since I had no experience prior to this JS project. But I really needed some external help to make the learning a little bit faster.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="description-paragraph-container">
            <h2 class="paragraph-title">Challenges</h2>
            <p class="paragraph-content">One of the first projects, of course it was challenging. Connect the API with the project took me a while to make it work. When I thought everything was lost, get in touch with my cousin and after a programing learning session was more clear to generate a good functional project.</p>

                <h2 class="paragraph-title">Process and Approach</h2>
                <p class="paragraph-content"> First, to follow the steps on making the visual part were ok, but once I started working on the API with JavaScript it gave me quite a few errors, I couldn’t really get in my head the JS functions and how to not having new errors in the script a lot of times, but just time, patience and some help, and it went through.<br><br>
    
                There where other tools like jQuery and Bootstrap, that working together with my cousin I could grasp some of the process to implement them in the project.
